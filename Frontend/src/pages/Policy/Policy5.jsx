      <h1>Plagiarism Policy</h1>
      <p>
        IJRST takes matters of violation of copyright, plagiarism or other
        publishing violations of professional standards very seriously. We
        strive to protect our authors' rights and we often examine allegations
        of plagiarism or abuse of articles written. Equally, we are seeking to
        defend the journal's integrity from malpractice. With
        duplication-checking software, submitted papers can be reviewed. Where
        an article is found to have plagiarised other work or contained
        copyright material from third parties without permission or with
        inadequate acknowledgment, or where the authorship of the article is
        questioned, we reserve the right to take action, including but not
        limited to: publishing an erratum or corrigendum (correction);
        withdrawing the article; taking up the matter with the head of
        department or dean of the authors institution and/or relevant academic
        bodies or societies; or taking appropriate legal action. Using
        CrossCheck/iThenticate plagiarism identification methods, documents
        submitted to the International Journal of Research in Science and
        Technology (IJRST) will be screened for plagiarism. Besides that,
        Copyscape scans for plagiarism. Without analysing the paper that
        contributes to plagiarism or self-plagiarism, IJRST would automatically
        reject documents. Complaints received from readers will be addressed
        promptly in an organised manner by the IJRST management team. In
        accordance with the guidance issued by COPE and OASPA, all complaints
        and reported scientific misconduct shall be handled.
