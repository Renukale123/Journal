      <h1>Article Correction Policy</h1>
      <p className="Small-heading">Online corrections</p>
      <p>
        The version of an article which is published online is considered the
        final and complete version. Even though it is possible to correct this
        version, our policy (in common with other publishers) is not to do so,
        except in very limited circumstances. We can only fix typographical
        errors in the following words: names of authors, affiliations, titles of
        articles, abstracts and keywords. In such instances, an erratum or a
        corrigendum will also be required (see below) so that the discrepancy
        between online and print versions can be clarified in a record. If there
        is a serious mistake, such as with regard to scientific accuracy, or if
        your credibility or that of the journal is affected, we can publish a
        correction to your paper. We do not publish corrections that do not
        materially impact the contribution or substantially damage the
        comprehension of the contribution by the reader (such as a spelling
        mistake or a grammatical error). If you need to make any changes, please
        send an email to info@ijrst.com
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Errata</p>
      <p>
        An erratum will be used if an important error has been introduced during
        the production of the journal article (one that affects the publication
        record, the scientific integrity of the paper, the reputation of the
        authors or of the journal), including errors of omission such as failure
        to make factual proof corrections requested by authors within the
        deadline provided by the journal and within journal policy. We do not
        publish errata for typing errors except where an apparently simple error
        is significant (for example, an incorrect unit). A significant error in
        a figure or table is corrected by publication of a new corrected figure
        or table as an erratum. The figure or table is republished only if the
        editor considers it necessary.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Corrigenda</p>
      <p>
        A corrigendum is a notification of an important error made by the
        authors of the article. All authors must sign corrigenda submitted for
        publication. In cases where co-authors disagree, the editors shall take
        advice from independent peer-reviewers and, in the text of the published
        edition, enforce the required modification, acknowledging the dissenting
        author(s).
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Addenda</p>
      <p>
        An addendum is a notification of a peer-reviewed addition of information
        to a paper in response to a request for clarification from a reader, for
        example. Addenda should not contradict the original publication, but if
        significant information available at the time was unintentionally
        omitted by the author, that material could be released as an addendum
        after peer review. Addenda are published only occasionally and only if
        the editors conclude that the addendum is important to the comprehension
        of a substantial portion of the published contribution by the reader.
