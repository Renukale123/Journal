      <p className="Small-heading">IJRST Follows Double blind Peer-Review</p>
      <p>
        International Journal of Research in Science and Technology strive to
        ensure that peer review is fair, unbiased and timely. Decisions to
        approve or reject a manuscript for publication are based on the
        importance, originality and consistency of the manuscript, and the
        validity of the research and its relation to the journal's
        responsibilities. In order to classify potential reviewers, we use a
        wide variety of sources, including the editorial board, personal
        information, feedback from the author, and bibliographic databases. In
        our decision as to whether to approve a manuscript for publication,
        reviewers' reviews play a major role.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Selection of Reviewers</p>
      <p>
        Reviewers are selected on the basis of a variety of criteria, including
        experience, previous publications in the same subject field, and prior
        review results (including quality and timeliness). Review invitations
        may contain sensitive information that should be treated as such.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Initial Manuscript Evaluation</p>
      <p>
        For completeness and adherence to the Guide for Writers, all new
        submissions are screened. Normally, authors of papers rejected at this
        point will be notified within 3-5 days.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Associate Editor Evaluation</p>
      <p>
        The Associate Editor will determine whether it warrants peer review or
        if it should be rejected without review when assigned a new submission.
        Manuscripts rejected at this point are insufficiently original, have
        significant conceptual and/or methodological defects, have weak grammar
        or English language, or are beyond the aims and scope of the journal.
        Authors of manuscripts rejected at this stage will normally be informed
        within 5-10 days. Those manuscripts deemed suitable for peer review are
        passed to at least 1 expert referees for review.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Reviewers Reports</p>
      <p>
        Reviewers are selected for the paper according to their expertise and
        our referee database is constantly being updated. Reviewers are asked to
        evaluate a manuscript for Originality and significance of contribution,
        interest to scholars, scientists and/or practitioners, relevance,
        coverage of appropriate existing literature, adequacy of methodology,
        analysis and interpretation, clear, concise and jargon-free writing
        style. Reviewers are asked to provide anonymous comments to the author
        and are also given the option of providing confidential comments to the
        editor. Typically the manuscript will be reviewed within 15-20 days.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">
        The Final Decision and Time to Publication
      </p>
      <p>
        The Associate Editor is responsible for the decision to reject or
        recommend the manuscript for publication. This decision will be sent to
        the author along with any recommendations made by the referees. After
        acceptance, it currently takes up to 5 days to publish article online.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Timeliness</p>
      <p>
        Because we are committed to provide timely editorial decisions,
        potential reviewers are requested to respond promptly and those who
        accept invitations to review are requested to provide their comments
        within the agreed timeframe. If reviewers anticipate that they will not
        be able to meet the deadline, they are requested to inform the assigning
        editor so that alternative arrangements can be made.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Potential Conflicts of Interest</p>
      <p>
        If a reviewer perceives that there may be a significant conflict of
        interest (financial or otherwise) for a particular manuscript that they
        are invited to review, they should either seek clarification with the
        assigning editor or decline the invitation.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Confidentiality</p>
      <p>
        Manuscripts are reviewed with due respect for authors’ and reviewers’
        confidentiality. As a condition of agreeing to assess the manuscript,
        all reviewers undertake to keep submitted manuscripts and associated
        data confidential. If a reviewer seeks advice from colleagues while
        assessing a manuscript, he or she ensures that confidentiality is
        maintained and that the names of any such colleagues are provided to the
        journal with the final report.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Anonymity</p>
      <p>
        We do not transfer on the identities of reviewers to authors. We
        strongly discourage reviewers from disclosing their identity as they may
        be asked to comment on other reviewers' critiques and on further
        manuscript revisions; it may be more difficult for identified reviewers
        to be impartial in such circumstances.
