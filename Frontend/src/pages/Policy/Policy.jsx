      <p>
        Open access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly
        research and literature freely available online to anyone interested in
        reading it. Open access has two different versions—gratis and libre.
        Gratis open access is simply making research available for others to
        read without having to pay for it. However, it does not grant the user
        the right to make copies, distribute, or modify the work in any way
        beyond fair use. Libre open access is gratis, meaning the research is
        available free of charge, but it goes further by granting users
        additional rights, usually via a Creative Commons license, so that
        people are free to reuse and remix the research. There are varying
        degrees of what may be considered Libre open access. For example, some
        scholarly articles may permit all uses except commercial use, some may
        permit all uses except derivative works, and some may permit all uses
        and simply require attribution. While some would argue that Libre open
        access should be free of any copyright restrictions (except
        attribution), other scholars consider a work that removes at least some
        permission barriers to be libre. In addition to the gratis/libre
        distinction regarding users’ rights to a work, there are also
        distinctions regarding the venue in which open access works are
        published and archived—green and gold. Green open access involves
        authors self-archiving their articles by sharing them on their own
        website, or more preferably, in their institution's Institutional
        Repository or in some other public archive. Gold open access articles
        are published in a journal that is open access, which means the journal
        will handle hosting and distributing the journal article in a free and
        open manner. Gold open access can come with a cost—some gold open access
        journals have publication fees that need to paid by the author (or the
        author's employer) to cover the cost of publishing the article. These
        publication fees can be costly, but thankfully less than a third of gold
        open access journals have a publication fee. Currently, most Gold open
        access journals are still publishing gratis (free of charge to read) as
        opposed to libre (free of charge to read, copy, distribute, etc).
