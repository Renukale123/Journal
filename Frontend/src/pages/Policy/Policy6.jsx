      <h1>Conflict of Interest Policy</h1>
      <p>
        When you (or your employer or sponsor) have a financial, economic,
        legal, or professional relationship with other organisations, or with
        the persons who work for them, you may have a conflict of interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you submit a paper to a journal, you must be completely
        transparent. First and foremost, the journal editor will use this data
        to guide his or her editorial decisions. They may then make such
        disclosures public to help readers evaluate the storey. Alternatively,
        the editor may decide not to publish your essay due to a declared
        conflict of interest. The conflict of interest can be declared in your
        cover letter or on the paper submission form in the journal's online
        peer-review system.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Personal Conflicts of Interest</p>

        Potential conflicts of interest in relation to your submitted manuscript
        could include:
        <ol>
          <li>Consultancies</li>

          <li>Advocacy groups</li>

          <li>Royalties</li>
          <li>Stock or share ownership</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        In a covering letter, please identify any potential conflicts of
        interest if necessary. In addition, you should provide full credit to
        all sources of funding for the project.
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Disclosure Statement</p>
      <p>
        Along with the body of your article, you should add a relevant
        disclosure statement. This can be done in conjunction with any
        acknowledgments and funding information.
