      <h1>Publication Ethics</h1>
      <h3>
        The rights and obligations of authors, editor, and reviewers are the
        following:
      </h3>
      <p className="Small-heading">Editors</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is the duty of the editor to determine which of the papers
            submitted to the journal will be published. Without regard to the
            race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin,
            citizenship, or political ideology of the authors, the editor will
            evaluate manuscripts. The decision will be based on the
            significance, originality and clarification of the article, and the
            validity of the research and its importance to the scope of the
            journal. It is also important to understand existing legal
            provisions for libel, copyright infringement, and plagiarism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any information concerning the manuscript submitted may not be
            revealed by the editor and any editorial staff to anyone other than
            the corresponding author, reviewers, prospective reviewers, other
            editorial advisors and the publisher, as appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The editor or members of the editorial board cannot use unpublished
            materials revealed in a submitted paper for their own research
            purposes without the express written consent of the author.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Authors</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authors should present an objective discussion of the significance
            of research work as well as sufficient detail and references to
            permit others to replicate the experiments. Fraudulent or knowingly
            inaccurate statements constitute unethical behaviour and are
            unacceptable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors may be asked to provide the research data supporting their
            paper for editorial review and/or to comply with the open data
            requirements of the journal. Authors should be prepared to provide
            public access to such data, if practicable, and should be prepared
            to retain such data for a reasonable number of years after
            publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            The authors should ensure that their work is entirely original
            works, and if the work and/or words of others have been used, this
            has been appropriately acknowledged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors should not submit manuscripts that reproduce papers already
            published, in whole or in part, in other journals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors can use their own articles, or part of them, in compilations
            of their own work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information obtained in the course of confidential services, such as
            refereeing manuscripts or grant applications, must not be used
            without the explicit written permission of the author of the work
            involved in these services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The corresponding author should ensure that there is a full
            consensus of all co-authors in approving the final version of the
            paper and its submission for publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in their
            own published work, it is the authorâ€™s obligation to promptly notify
            the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to
            retract or correct the paper if deemed necessary by the editor. If
            the editor or the publisher learn from a third party that a
            published work contains an error, it is the obligation of the author
            to cooperate with the editor, including providing evidence to the
            editor where requested.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Publishers</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The publisher must warrant that the manuscripts received will
            undergo a process of anonymous peer evaluation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The publisher will observe the norms of the publication in copyright
            matters.
          </li>
          <li>
            The publisher will only assess the intellectual value of the
            manuscripts, regardless of race, nationality, gender, ethnicity,
            beliefs or ideology of the author.
          </li>
          <li>
            The publisher should take reasonable responsive measures when
            ethical complaints have been presented concerning a submitted
            manuscript or published paper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="Small-heading">Associate Editor Evaluation</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reviewers will not report on manuscripts which may create conflicts
            of interest resulting from competition, collaboration or any other
            relations with the author.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewers will be fully objective and will clearly argument their
            viewpoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewers should report possible cases of plagiarism or too obvious
            similarities between the evaluated manuscript and other published
            works they know.
          </li>
          <li>
            Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be
            kept confidential and not used for personal advantage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research
            reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be
            impossible should notify the editor and decline to participate in
            the review process.
