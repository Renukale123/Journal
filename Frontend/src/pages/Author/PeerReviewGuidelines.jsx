        International Journal of Research in Science and Technology remains
        focused to disseminate scientific knowledge, and the credibility of the
        published paper totally depends on the efficient mechanism of peer
        review. A significant part of the publishing process is the examination
        of manuscripts. In order to ensure that the scientific content of the
        manuscript is on line with our expectations, reviewers are invited to
        make an assessment and provide recommendations. It is not intended for
        reviewers to rewrite an article. IJRST reviewers are asked to provide
        the accompanying manuscript with genuine, constructive review feedback
        and criticisms. Within the clearly stated timeframe, a reviewer has to
        check the papers obtained from the editorial office or the editor.

        In order to help publish reliable, insightful and creative articles
        geared towards the interests of undergraduate and graduate students,
        manuscript reviewers are important. In order to eventually determine
        which manuscripts will be published in the journal, IJRST relies on the
        experience and expertise of its reviewers. A significant first step in
        the publishing process is reviewing manuscripts.â€‹

      <p>
        Reviewer is requested, after receiving the invitation, to inform about
        their availability to complete the review in a given period. Your view
        of accepting or denying the invitation can be intimated to us. You may
        suggest some of your colleagues if you are unable to accept the
        invitation, so that the respective editor may invite the person to
        review and you may not pass your invitation. Articles are assigned
        depending on the reviewer's specialization. If the manuscript is beyond
        their knowledge, they should contact the assigned editorial office.
        After appointing the manuscript reviewer, if there is any issue with
        time or conflict of interest, the reviewer will contact the editorial
        office on the grounds that the reviewer can extend the deadline or
        cancel the review assignment. The reviewer should take a look at the
        manuscript assigned, whether or not the paper works within the journal's
        specified framework. When reviewing the manuscript, reviewers should not
        be biased or partial. To encourage timely completion of the review
        process, they should analyze the manuscript within the given timeline.
        If you notice that the research paper does not fit into the scope of
        interest during the review process, you should notify the editorial
        office. Reviewers are not invited to communicate the paper with the
        relevant author(s). We advise reviewers not to use the manuscript data
        for their own use and to protect it from some kind of breach. Criticism
        should be dispassionately expressed and negative statements are not
        acceptable. Confidential comments to be made and for approval, rejection
        or alteration, you may advise the editor. They must never be affected by
        race, religion, nationality, ethnicity, language, origin, gender or any
        political entity in their comments and reviews. If you are willing to
        join our journal as a reviewer, please mail us your CV and the journal
        of interest to info@ijrst.com. Within 24 hours, we will respond to you.

        Associate Editors may be promoted in the journal concerned as Editors,
        Executive Editor and Senior Editor on the basis of their active
        involvement and experience. There is an opportunity to serve as a
        leading member of the advisory board, based on their valuable efforts
        and their effectiveness. The review comments offered by the editors will
        be followed strictly, after which the authors will be asked to change
        their manuscript according to their suggestions/comments. Editorials are
        taken into account by IJRST as a note to young researchers and
        academics.
